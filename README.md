## 🔍 About Me

I'm Arpitha, an aspiring Data Analyst passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights that support smarter decision-making. I enjoy exploring datasets, identifying patterns, and presenting clear, data-driven stories through visualizations and reports. My goal is to use analytical thinking and technical skills to solve real-world problems with data.

As part of my learning journey, I am actively building strong skills in Power BI, SQL, Python, and Excel. I work on end-to-end data projects involving data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation. Whether it’s structuring messy datasets, uncovering trends, or designing intuitive dashboards, I focus on delivering clarity and value through data.

Coming from a finance background, I naturally gravitate towards structured thinking, precision, and understanding business metrics. These experiences help me approach data with a problem-solving mindset and translate insights into actionable recommendations.

I’m continuously learning and improving my knowledge in:

📈 Data Visualization – Power BI, Excel

🧪 SQL – Data extraction & querying

🐍 Python – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

🧹 Data Cleaning 

🎨 Dashboard Design & Data Storytelling
